# Personal Finance
Tool to explore your finances with [pandas]


**Note:** this assumes all financial transactions can fit into memory. Future work includes using [Spark] for cases that cannot.

#### Setup

1. Download [Anaconda] (Python 3 Version)
2. From the root directory personalfinance/ create the conda environment. See [conda env docs] for details.

```conda env create -f environment.yml```

3. TBD (instructions for where to put all your transactions and what to run **coming soon**)
